## Hi there 👋
- I am a molecular pharmacologist with over 15 years of experience at the intersection of molecular cancer biology, pharmacology, and computational biology.
- I study how DNA damage response (DDR) pathways influence tumor development and therapeutic response using:
    - High-throughput screening (CRISPR, siRNA, chemical)
    - Multi-omics (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, kinome)
- I primarily use R. I also have experience with python and MATLAB.
- I am deeply committed to expanding my machine learning and modeling capabilities, making it a point to learn new skills almost every month.
