## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
- I am a molecular pharmacologist with over 15 years of experience at the intersection of molecular cancer biology, pharmacology, and computational biology.
- I study how DNA damage response (DDR) pathways influence tumor development and therapeutic response using:
    - High-throughput screening (CRISPR, siRNA, chemical)
    - Multi-omics (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, kinome)
    - Model systems (cell lines, 3D spheroids, mice)
    - Nucleic acid techniques (DNA/RNA extarction and analysis, PCR, qPCR, RT-PCR, cloning, gene editing, library preparation, Next-Generation Sequencing)
    - Protein biochemistry (western blotting, protein expression and purification, ELISA, ITC, Co-IP, Pull-down assays, spectrophotometric assays, ultracentrifuge, chromatography)
    - Microscopy (light, flourescence, confocal, time-lapse)
    - FLow cytometry
- I primarily use R. I also have experience working with UNIX, python, MATLAB and high throughput computing cluster.
